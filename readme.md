Here's a **detailed explanation** of the given code, step by step. It explains how the **Bag of Words (BoW) vectorization** works and how **sentence similarity is calculated** using a custom `VectorStore`. ðŸš€  

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Importing Required Libraries**
```python
from vector_store import VectorStore
import numpy as np
```
- **`vector_store`** is imported from `vector_store.py`, which likely handles vector storage and similarity calculation.
- **`numpy`** is used for numerical computations.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Defining Sentences**
```python
sentences = ["I love machine learning", 
             "I love deep learning", 
             "I love natural language processing"]
```
- We have **three sentences** that we will vectorize and store.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Tokenization & Vocabulary Building**
```python
vocabulary = set()

for sentence in sentences:
    tokens = sentence.lower().split()  # Convert to lowercase & split into words
    vocabulary.update(tokens)  # Add words to the vocabulary
```
### **ðŸ“Œ What Happens Here?**
- **Converts sentences into lowercase** to avoid case sensitivity issues.
- **Splits sentences into words (tokens).**
- **Builds a unique vocabulary** of all words.

### **ðŸ›  Example:**
For the given sentences, the vocabulary might look like:
```python
{'i', 'love', 'machine', 'learning', 'deep', 'natural', 'language', 'processing'}
```

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Assigning Unique IDs to Words**
```python
word_to_index = {word: i for i, word in enumerate(vocabulary)}
```
- This **maps each word to a unique index** for vector representation.

### **ðŸ“Œ Example:**
```python
{'i': 0, 'love': 1, 'machine': 2, 'learning': 3, 'deep': 4, 'natural': 5, 'language': 6, 'processing': 7}
```
Now, we can **quickly look up** any word's index.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Vectorizing Sentences (BoW Representation)**
```python
sentence_vectors = {}

for sentence in sentences:
    vector = np.zeros(len(vocabulary))  # Create a zero vector
    tokens = sentence.lower().split()   # Tokenize sentence
    for token in tokens:
        vector[word_to_index[token]] += 1  # Increment word count
    
    sentence_vectors[sentence] = vector  # Store the vector
```
### **ðŸ“Œ What Happens Here?**
- Creates a **zero vector** of size = number of unique words in vocabulary.
- Iterates through words in the sentence and **increments the corresponding index** in the vector.

### **ðŸ›  Example:**
For `"I love machine learning"`, assuming vocabulary indexes as above:
```python
[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] 
# 'i' (1), 'love' (1), 'machine' (1), 'learning' (1), rest are 0
```
Similarly, for `"I love deep learning"`:
```python
[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
# 'deep' appears (1), but 'machine' is absent (0)
```

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Storing Vectors in the `VectorStore`**
```python
vector_store = VectorStore()

for sentence, vector in sentence_vectors.items():
    vector_store.add_vector(sentence, vector)
```
- **Stores each sentence vector** in `VectorStore`, so we can later retrieve and compare similar sentences.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Step 7: Querying for Similar Sentences**
```python
query_sentence = "I love deep learning"

query_vector = np.zeros(len(vocabulary))

query_tokens = query_sentence.lower().split()

for token in query_tokens:
    query_vector[word_to_index[token]] += 1
```
- **Creates a vector representation** for `"I love deep learning"`.
- **Follows the same BoW process** as before.

### **ðŸ“Œ Example:**
For `"I love deep learning"`, the vector will be:
```python
[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0] 
```
(Similar to the one stored earlier!)

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Step 8: Finding Similar Sentences**
```python
similar_sentences = vector_store.find_similar_vectors(query_vector, num_results=2)
```
- **Finds the top 2 most similar sentences** from `VectorStore`.
- Likely uses **Cosine Similarity**:
  \[
  \text{similarity} = \frac{A \cdot B}{\|A\| \|B\|}
  \]
  where \( A \) and \( B \) are sentence vectors.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Step 9: Printing Similar Sentences**
```python
print("Query sentence:", query_sentence)
print("Similar sentences:")

for sentence, similarity in similar_sentences:
    print(f"{sentence} : similarity={similarity:.4f}")
```
- **Prints the query sentence** and the most similar sentences with similarity scores.

### **ðŸ“Œ Example Output:**
```plaintext
Query sentence: I love deep learning
Similar sentences:
I love deep learning : similarity= 1.0000
I love machine learning : similarity= 0.7500
```
- `"I love deep learning"` is **identical**, so **similarity = 1**.
- `"I love machine learning"` shares **three out of four words**, so it has **high similarity**.
